    <p>The most important part of the navigation structure at Victoria's Secret was the masthead — a monolithic component containing brand navigation and utility links. The masthead was persistent across the website, providing the same functions throught the customer's shopping experience. This contrasted the model of a customer's shopping journey where a given customer had different needs and exhibited specific behavior based on the page they were on. This project was a ground up effort to redesign the navigation structure of the website in order to make it simplified and responsive to user and business needs. </p>

      <h4>Usage of brand tabs</h4>
      <p>After looking at the analytics data, I realized that the engagement with the brand tabs decreased as the customer ventured deep into the shopping funnel. Engagement for the brand tabs was highest on the home page(s), and then it declined steadily with product pages seeing <1% engagement. This made me question the decision to persistently show the brand tab bar, which occupied significant real estate on screen. </p>

      <h4>A static masthead</h4>
      <p>The masthead provided the same functionality throughout the website, irrespective of the page type. Previous customer research had identified that a certain feature was more important on a specific pages and less important on the other pages. There was a potential to prioritize functionality based on the type of the page the customer was on.. </p>
    </div> 
  </div>
 
  <div class="para">
    <!-- <h4>IDENTIFYING ELEMENTS</h4> -->
      <p>I mapped out all the masthead elements and classified them under the following groups — navigation, offer and utility. This was necessary to make sure I covered all use cases. The contextual grouping of these elements, clubbed together with usage data from analytics, informed the new navigation structure. The hypothesis for this project was as follows - </p>

      <p>——</p>
      <h3>We believe that a modular and dynamic masthead, which provides relevant functionality to narrow down selection at each step of the customer journey, will enable our customers to more easily navigate the broad assortment of products. </h3>
      <p>——</p>

    <h4>INTRODUCING THE MODULAR MASTHEAD</h4>
      <p> 
       The modular masthead is a system of components where each component/ module serves a unique purpose. The underlying structure is governed by a set of rules which allows it to understand and adapt to customer needs, while being highly customizable by brand partners. 
      <ul>
        <li>Segmented – builds up on each individual component’s potential</li>
        <li>Modular – allows higher degree of freedom while setting up navigation</li> 
        <li>Flexible – adapts to customers' needs and augments their shopping experience</li>
        <li>Responsive – respects device widths and constraints</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <div class="para">
    <h4>THE COMPOSITION</h4>
    <p>The modular masthead is broken down into three main components - offers module, navigation module and utility module. The offers module contains the sitewide offer(s), with a potential to allow multiple offers to be displayed in the space. The navigation module contains the brand logo, the hamburger menu and auxiliary links such as account, search and shopping bag. The utility module is a place for page specific utilities such as sticky categories on home and landing pages, sticky filters for collection pages and product information on product pages. The utility space was created to add page specific functionality to fulfill the customer needs. </p>

        <h4>Configurable modules</h4>
        <p>Since the modular masthead was planned to be used across all 4 brands, it was necessary to make the components configurable. This would allow brand expression while providing the vital navigation related functionality to customers. The idea was to enable brand partners to customize background color, text color and fonts while maintaining a similar structure.</p>

        <h4>Stackable modules</h4>
        <p>A novel feature of this system was that the modules could be stacked in more than a single configuration. This was crucial because customers had well defined needs on specific pages. The stackable nature of the modules would allow brand partners to set up different combinations of modules to fulfill customer as well as business needs.For example, it was not important from a customer perspective to view offers when they were browsing a collection page or looking at products on a product page.</p>

        <h4>Responsive modules</h4>
        <p>Historically, the masthead had proved to be a blocker in creating a responsive web experience at Victoria's Secret. Simplifying the masthead structure would enable individual modules to be responsive to different browser widths. This was a crucial first step in the direction of creating a consistent web experience.  </p>

   <div class="para">
      <h4>TO SUMMARIZE</h4>
      <p>The modular masthead is a forward–looking concept that is a redesign of the current navigation on the website. This concept is meant to be a Northstar that guides the explorations for future enhancements. Since this model involves drastic changes to the navigation structure, the project has been broken down into multiple smaller projects that are in the works. The offers module has already been developed and shipped on the mobile website with more improvements coming soon. </p>
