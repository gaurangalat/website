                <h4>WHAT IS EMOSENSE?</h4>
                <p>EmoSense is a wearable product that lets you share your emotions. The main idea behind developing EmoSense is to let users share their experiences using wearables. Wearable technology today offers a personal experience, which the user cannot share with others. The aim of EmoSense is to create sharing of emotions using wearable technology.</p>
                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
                <h4>WHY DID WE DESIGN THIS?</h4>
                <p>Almost all people experience emotional problems at a stage in their life. Sometimes they prefer to deal with it on their own and do not wish to let others know of their suffering. Sometimes they long for someone to help them out, and talk to them. Some prefer to get medical assistance. Usually people try to ignore the problem and then it deteriorates into a serious condition, resulting into depression and in some cases, harming themselves.</p>
                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
                <h4>WHAT IDEA DID WE PROPOSE?</h4>
                <p>The idea was to develop a pair of wearables, where one would be worn by a user and the second would be worn by another. By employing haptic feedback, User A can be made self-reliant by turning on the vibration when stress is detected, or User B can be notified that User A is feeling stressed. User B can then activate the heating pad placed inside the glove of User A. The heating pad is supposed to provide warmth and comfort to User A.</p>

                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
                <h4>WHAT WAS OUR PROCESS?</h4>
                <p>The team was formed because of our common objective â€“ of sharing experiences using wearable technology. Holding on to this thought, we started brainstorming using post-its and grouped the ideas sharing a common theme. We then devised 3 different personas, envisioning people who would really use the product. We targeted negative emotions such as fear, anxiety, anger, stress and sadness. 
                </p>
                <img src="ideas.jpg" alt="Ideas">
                <p>After listing down the ideas that could target the aforementioned emotions, we looked at the inventory of devices available. Refining the idea again considering the plausibility of each, we moved on to the sketching phase and sketched out design ideas. By this time we had a clear idea of what we wanted to implement. The next and final step was prototyping, which began with individual sensor testing and finally resulted into sensor integration with LilyPad Arduino.</p>
                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

                <h4>HOW DID WE IMPLEMENT IT?</h4>
                <p>The prototype integrated about 80% of the final idea, and basically had a 2-way communication mechanism. Due to time constraints, work on wireless transmission had to be stopped midway and we focused only on the integration and 2-way communication. Setup mounted on left hand symbolises the circuit on an individual, while the setup on the right hand shows the circuit for another individual.</p>
                <!-- <img src="EmoSense.jpg" alt="Final Prototype" style="-webkit-transform:rotate(90deg);"> -->
                <p>Circuitry mounted on the left hand used a muscle sensor to measure EMG signals. When a stress in the muscles was detected, the haptic motor on the right hand would start vibrating, thus serving as a notification. The right hand had a flex sensor and anytime the wrist was closed, it would send a signal to the left hand, turning on the heating pad. In the video attached, we replaced the heating pad with a simple LED on the LilyPad for demonstration purposes.</p>
                <img src="GeneralPresentation.png" alt="Working">
                <p>The developed product served the following purposes- 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Self reliance</b> due to haptic feedback</li>
                    <li><b>Peer support</b> system</li>
                    <li><b>Sharing</b> of emotional experience</li>
                    <li><b>Notifying</b> friends/ family/ doctors about an issue</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
                <h4>WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER?</h4>
                <p>Integrating all the sensors actuators and enabling wireless communication in under a day was the main challenge for us. We had to modify some of the ideas from our brainstorming session because of limited time and material availability.</p>
                
                <p>The wiring between the two setups could be replaced by using WiFi or Bluetooth technology. To increase self reliance, the stress signal can be sent to a Bluetooth speaker so that calming sountracks can be played in the environment of the user. This signal could also be used to modify ambient lighting in the room to induce a feeling of comfort and warmth.</p>
