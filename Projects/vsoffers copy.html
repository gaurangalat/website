    <p>Offers were one of most loved features of the shopping experience for a Victoria's Secret customer.   </p>

      <h4>DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER</h4>
      <p>The only way to trigger the offer drawer on desktop was to click Today's Offers. This trigger was missed by a lot of customers, as seen in various research studies, mainly because it was not obvious. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>A POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE USABILITY</h4>
      <p>On opening the drawer, the customer would be presented with a scrollable row of offer cards, often exceeding 20 offers. A customer who would miss out on the carets in the drawer would wrongly assume that the website only offered 4 offers.</p>

      <h4>A COSTLY DIVERSION</h4>
      <p>Offers on the mobile website were present on a separate page available through a link inside the hamburger menu. To view these offers, a customer had to navigate away from the page they were viewing. This diversion caused customers to abandon their shopping journey, potentially leading to a loss in revenue. Moreover, a long page of offers did not provide any value to users looking for offers on specific pages/ brands.</p>

    <h4>REDESIGNING THE OFFERS EXPERIENCE</h4>
      <p>I worked together with the UX Lead from the Checkout Team to scope out the project. We planned the redesign of the Offers drawer using a multi-phase approach, where each phase aimed to achieve a specific outcome. The work was prioritized based on the level of effort and the impact it would have. We planned to tackle low effort, high impact work first, working our way towards an ideal future state.  </p>

        <h4>Improving discoverability</h4>
        <p>The first step was to improve the trigger that would prompt the Offer drawer. I had been working on a different project which involved making the sitewide offer (Free Shipping offer) more flexible. Based on the requirements, I had decided to move the offer to its own space above the global navigation. I repurposed that space to also include the trigger for the offer drawer. 
        </p>
        <p>  
        Furthermore, I decided to reuse an existing design pattern and retrofit the offers inside it thus creating a vertical Offers drawer. This change would allow not only allow a more natural way to scroll offers but also open up opportunities to improve the contents of the drawer.  
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div> 

   <div class="para">
      <p>To gauge how this proposed enhancement would fare in the actual shopping journey, we A/B tested it against a control version for 2 weeks with a 50/50 traffic split. The test results of the A/B test were flat, indicating that there was no significant increase in orders or revenue, our primary metrics for the test.</p>This design on desktop and mobile was put through multiple sessions of unmoderated usability testing.

        <h4>Making offers easy to understand</h4>
        <p>The way we presented offers to the customers had a potential for improvements. The hypothesis was that grouping offers would reduce extraneous cognitive load on customers, given that studies show humans have a limited working memory and that time to make a decision increases exponentially with the number of choices available. Another benefit of grouping offers was that an optimal grouping strategy would enable customers to easily discover offers suited to their needs. These benefits would in turn increase offer redemption and improve customer loyalty.</p>
        <p>I saw a potential to create brand-specific tabs/ filters. Not only would this create a logical segmentation of offers but also it could allow each brand to directly link customers to their own section inside the Offers drawer. Since each offer was already set up in the CMS with the brand it referred to, it required a very small effort on the front-end side to create the filtering functionality with tabs. </p>

        <h4>Improving the offer card structure</h4>
        <p>All offer cards were set up in CMS but their structure varied across brands. Due to lack of standards and the need for more flexibility, the brands used a variety of hacks to customize the look of their offer cards. The diverse designs made it slightly harder for a customer to understand the offers at a glance. There was an opportunity to make the offer cards flexible and consistent, with a well defined information hierarchy.</p>

    <h4>WHAT CONSTITUTES A GOOD OFFER?</h4>
    <p>To understand how an ideal offer card would look, I decided to set up a card sorting exercise. The goal of this exercise was to understand which components of an offer card were important to the customer, why they were important and if the delivery mechanism (web, mobile, email) influenced the ideal design. This exercise was done remotely over Figma, with information fields similar to the ones used for the current offer cards. There were 4 themes to this exercise â€“ lingerie, beauty, accessories and apparel. I chose to use generic examples to prevent customers' biases/ preferences from affecting their decisions/ true choices. </p>

  <div class="para">
    <h4>INSIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITY AREAS</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>The most important information in an offer card - what is the offer, how do I redeem it and how long do I have to redeem it (Title, Offer Code, Label)</li>
        <li>A tangible deadline is more compelling and invokes a sense of urgency (Ends Friday > Limited Time Offer)</li> 
        <li>Images convey information about the product and fit but are not important in an offer</li>
        <li>Offer code was deemed to be relatively more important than Click to Apply action</li>
        <li>Shop Now provides a convenient way of redeeming an offer but is not an essential component in the offer card</li>
        <li>Desired information density is dependent on the medium of offer delivery (website/ mobile/ email)</li>
