    <p>Research done over the years validated the industry-wide hypothesis that the shopping experience is non-linear. We had observed that a purchase would happen over multiple visits by the customer. There was no single reason behind this; it was simply a result of the culmination of various factors largely related to customer behavior. There was an opportunity to understand this behavior and improve conversion. </p> 
  </div>

  <div class="para">
    <h5>CHALLENGE</h5>
    <h4>High cart abandonment rate</h4>
    <p>Customers typically built/ curated their cart over several browsing sessions. This behavior also led to cart abandonment scenarios where a customer added items to their cart but did not return to complete the purchase, leading to a loss in revenue. Items left in the cart for a prolonged period of time also risked becoming sold out/ not available leading to frustrations at the customer's end. Although the marketing department sent cart reminder emails to customers, most customer did not engage with the emails as seen by the low click through rate.</p>

    <h5>Research</h5>
    <h4>Understanding customer types</h4>
    <p>Previous research had shown that there were 4 kinds of customers shopping with us. These were very similar to the 5 shopper types put together by the Nielsen Norman Group. These 4 types had distinct behaviors as shown below
    <ul>
        <li>Browsers: leisure shoppers who visit websites for checking new products or for inspiration</li>
        <li>Researchers: shoppers who carefully compare products, prices over multiple sessions</li>
        <li>Bargain hunters: shoppers who are looking for good deals</li>
        <li>Product focused: shoppers who know exactly what they want to buy</li>
      </ul></p>
  </div>

  <div class="para">
    <h5>Research</h5>
    <h4>Identifying the target audience</h4>
    <p>Checking analytics and comparing these types against visitor behavior, we found that the majority of our customers were either Browsers, Researchers or Bargain hunters, with Product focused representing a small set of daily visitors. Combing through multiple qualitative studies done by our researchers helped me understand the correlation between customer type and intent to purchase. The image below shows customer types being arranged on a scale showing intent to purchase. </p>

  <div class="para">
    <p>The image above shows clearly that Browsers' intent to purchase isn't as strong as the other three types of customers. In other words, Browsers were not contributing much to the revenue earned from online sales. Combining this with the fact that Product focused customers represented a minority of our daily visitors, it became evident that designing a solution that catered towards Researchers and Bargain hunters would deliver the maximum value and increase conversion. <!-- This was backed by the findings of a survey done in June, that found that 35% of the total cart abandonment instances were attributed to custmers waiting for price reductions (Bargain hunters) and customers who were simply checking product availability (Researchers). -->

    <h5>Design</h5>
    <h4>Initial Iterations</h4>  
    <p>I decided to reuse an existing design pattern and retrofit the offers inside it to create a vertically oriented Offers drawer. This change not only allowed customers to scroll through offers in a more natural way but also opened up opportunities for us to improve the structure of the drawer. Changing the orientation of the drawer enabled us to bring the mobile and desktop offers experience a bit closer.
    </p>

  <div class="para">
    <h5>Phase Three</h5>
    <h4>Making offers easy to understand</h4>
    <p>The way we presented offers to the customers had potential for some improvements. The hypothesis was that grouping offers would reduce extraneous cognitive load on customers, given that studies show humans have a limited working memory and that time to make a decision increases exponentially with the number of choices available. An optimal grouping strategy would also enable customers to easily discover offers suited to their needs. These benefits would in turn increase offer redemption and improve customer loyalty.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To solve this issue, I decided to create brand-specific tabs and group offers into buckets. Not only would this create a logical segmentation of offers but also it could allow each brand to directly link customers to their own section inside the Offers drawer. Since each offer card was set up in the CMS with the brand it referred to, it required a very small effort on the front-end side to create the tab functionality.</p>
  </div>

  </div>

    <div class="para">
      <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
      <p>Here is what an ideal state would look like with all of the aforementioned improvements in place. This step was necessary to ensure that all design decisions still made sense after putting it all together and looking at the entire end to end offer experience. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="para">
    <h4>Taking a pause...</h4>
    <p>At this point, it was necessary to test our hypotheses and observe how customers would engage with the functionality we had developed so far. This step was crucial in making sure we had covered our bases, and most importantly, discovering areas where we could improve the design. I developed click-through protoypes for the desktop and mobile experience, and conducted moderated usability testing with a total of 12 participants. The usability test involved a couple of tasks with a pre and post test survey. </p>

  </div>


  <div class="para">
    <h4>...continuing the momentum</h4>
    <p>As I updated the container for the offers, another issue became apparent. Historically, sitewide offers were always prioritized over brand-specific offers. Since they were applicable to the entire website, they were visible under each brand-specific tab. So, if there were a couple of sitewide offers available, a customer switching between the brand tabs in the drawer would see the same few offers above the fold of the page. This could potentially lead to confusion at the customer's end. There was a potential to make the offer card design consistent and compact which would alleviate this issue while improving the customer experience. </p>
  </div>
    

  <div class="para">
    <h4>Studying the offer cards</h4>
    <p>Even though all offer cards were set up in a similar way in the CMS, their structure varied across brands and offer types. Due to lack of standards and the need for more flexibility, the brands used a variety of hacks to customize the look of their offer cards. Inconsistent designs made it slightly harder for a customer to understand the offers at a glance. There was a clear opportunity to make the offer cards consistent, with a well defined information hierarchy. A simplified offer card structure would also allow more offer cards to be visible in the drawer, at any given time.</p>

  <div class="para">
    <h5>Research</h5>
    <h4>But what constitutes an ideal offer?</h4>
    <p>To understand what constitutes an ideal offer card, I decided to set up a card sorting exercise. The goal of this exercise was to understand which components of an offer card were important to the customer, why they were important and how the delivery mechanism (web, mobile, email) influenced the ideal design. This exercise was done remotely over Figma, with participants dragging pieces of information into place based on their preferences. There were 4 themes to this exercise – lingerie, beauty, accessories and apparel. I chose to use generic examples to prevent customers' biases/ preferences from affecting their decisions/ true choices. </p>

  <div class="para">
    <h4>Card sort study insights</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>According to the test participants, the most important information in an offer card is - what is the offer, how do I redeem it and how long do I have to redeem it (Title, Offer Code, Label)</li>
        <li>A tangible deadline is more compelling and invokes a sense of urgency (Ends Friday > Limited Time Offer)</li> 
        <li>Images convey information about the product and fit but are not important in an offer</li>
        <li>Offer code was deemed to be relatively more important than Click to Apply action</li>
        <li>Shop Now provides a convenient way of redeeming an offer but is not an essential component in the offer card</li>
        <li>Desired information density is dependent on the medium of offer delivery (website/ mobile/ email)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>


  <div class="para">
    <h5>Phase Four</h5>
    <h4>Design explorations for new offer card</h4>
    <p>The next step was to convert the actionable insights from the card sort exercise into tangible outputs. My goal was to design an offer card structure with a clear hierarchy of information dictated by customer needs, that could be used on mobile as well as the desktop website. I also explored a few high fidelity options to see if a single design structure could work for all brand-specific offers.

  	<h4>Building out the experience</h4>
  	<p>
    My product team and I broke down this multi-phase project into testable outputs that could be achieved over several sprints. The team managed to complete the development of the new offer trigger (pink bar) and the vertical drawer late last year, achieveing half of the planned improvements.
	<br>
	<br>
	As 2020 approached, I moved to the new Personalization team to lead the design efforts for multi-platform personalized experiences. So, I handed over the project to a couple of other designers who are currently making headway into creating the brand tab functionality.</p>
