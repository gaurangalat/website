                <br>
                <p>My primary project as a designer on the mobile team, was to redesign the Security Checkup feature. This feature was released as a Beta* feature (Admin account only) in early 2017, and was slated for a General Availability (GA) release in Fall 2017. This meant that the target audience now included all users of Duo Mobile and not just Admin users. Redesigning the feature for a different target audience provided me an opportunity to work on various aspects of the project such as iconography, language and interactions.</p> 
                <p style="font-size: 14px;line-height:22px; "><i>*Duo tests new features by releasing them to a small subset of users running a Beta version of Duo Mobile</i></p>

                <h4>THE SECURITY CHECKUP FEATURE</h4>
                <!-- Security Checkup informs the user about the security hygiene of their device by alerting them to issues such as no passcode, out of date OS, etc and providing instructions for remediation of the detected issue. The objective of the feature is to caution the user about the security issues while being unobstrusive i.e. not compromising on any functionality of the app.-->

                <p>The Security Checkup feature, meant to check security hygiene of a device, had two aspects to it – Why and How. By alerting the user to security issues on their device such as no passcode, out of date OS, etc. it aimed to highlight good practices (eg. Why should you have a passcode?) and provide instructions for remediation of the detected issue (How to enable a passcode?).</p> <!-- The objective of the feature was to caution the user about the security issues while being unobstrusive i.e. not compromising on any functionality of the app. -->

                <br>
                <h4>NEEDED SOME DESIGN FIXES</h4>
                <!-- <p>The feature in its Beta phase did a good job at explaining why a particular good security practice was important but did not provide detailed enough instructions for remediation of the issue. Moreover, the feature was grouped on the home screen, with another feature, that was going to be taken out for the GA release. This meant that it was necessary to rethink where the Security Checkup feature would be located and how would a user interact with it. Lastly, we wanted users to perceive the feature as a 'helper' rather than just an alert. We found out that this could be achieved by using a different alert icon and changing the text.
                </p> -->
                <p>Initial testing of the feature in the Beta version brought three problems to light. Users perceived the feature as simply an alert rather than a helper. The feature also did not accomodate edge cases that affected users' trust in the feature. Moreover, the feature was grouped on the home screen, with another feature, that was going to be taken out for the GA release. This meant that it was necessary to rethink where the Security Checkup feature would be located and how would a user interact with it. </p>
                
                
                <br>
                <h4>THE REDESIGN FLOW</h4>
                
                <!-- <h4>HOW I DID IT</h4>
                <p>My mentor played a huge role in shaping the project - through regular 1:1 meetings, we were able to narrow down the scope of the project and establish a timeline. The timeline accounted for various phases such as brainstorming, designing and frequent feedback/ standup sessions. I rapidly designed and verified the prototypes by hallway testing* them and also showing it to the other designers at Duo. I also found it beneficial to get opinions on my designs from a different perspective such as a developer's.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 14px;line-height:22px; "><i>*Hallway testing is a quick way of testing design concepts by utilizing bystanders in a hallway (or a high foot traffic area) as test participants</i></p>  
                <br>
                
                <br>
                <br> -->
                <p>The entire redesign comprised three main stages — changing the perception, designing for accommodating edge cases and improving the user interaction. </p>
                <p><b>I. Improving the users' perception</b></p>
                <!-- <p>Some users had no control over a few security issues (such as manufacturers discontinuing OS updates for old phones, especially for Android). The strong language and red alert icons for these flagged issues made such users feel helpless and resulted into frustration. To alleviate this issue, I decided to change the way users perceived an alert by redesigning the icon. In this process, I looked at how existing products such as antivirus softwares handled alerts and created different iterations by tweaking the symbols and colors.</p> -->
                <p>I realized that the perception of the feature resulted from a combination of visuals and the tone of the copy. The goal was to make the users perceive the feature as a helper and not a mere alert. To tackle this issue I decided to tone down strong visuals (icons), rephrase some of the harshly worded copy and provide more context to the users by adding text (soft landing). </p>
                <img src="SCold.png" alt="icon iterations">
                <p>Factoring in the feedback from some quick testing sessions, I decided to choose the icon that provided a high contrast and was easily distinguishable from the green (all okay) icon. I came up with this final icon after changing the color of the icon from red to yellow and using an exclamation mark instead of a cross to make it resemble a warning. The shape of the icon was also changed from a circle to a triangle to distinguish it from the green (all okay) icon.</p>
                <img src="duo_perception.png" alt="Landing text and icon change">
                <br>
                <p><b>II. Designing for edge cases to improve users' trust</b></p>
                <!-- <p>There were cases where Android users who had enabled Full Disk Encryption (FDE) were getting notified by the feature stating that their FDE was disabled, leading to confusion. It was found that devices having FDE enabled but with no passcode enabled were not passing the security test done by the feature. Remediation instructions that factored in such cases were missing in the Beta version. Additionally, the text label explicitly saying ‘FDE not enabled’ added to the confusion at the user’s end.</p> -->
                <p>There were two edge cases for Android users that surfaced during initial testing of the Beta feature — Full Disk Encryption (FDE) and Operating System (OS). I had to design separate pages comprising remediation instructions for the normal and edge cases with links to those on the main page. It was necessary that users understood that the links were hyperlinks and would open a new page in the Duo Mobile app and not the browser. To tackle these two issues, I changed the tone of the text in the links to first person to make them stand out from the text under each label. I also added a slight background fill for the links to make them pop out on the screen. </p>
                <img src="FDElanding.png" alt="concept iterations for dropdown contents for FDE">
                <!-- <p>My first step was to change the language from 'FDE not enabled' to 'FDE issue detected’ in the text label. Next, I added some landing text in the dropdown to provide more context to the text label and lead the user to further actions. As the remediation instructions had to account for <i>normal cases</i> (FDE not enabled) and <i>edge cases</i> (FDE enabled + no passcode), I decided to create separate pages for these two cases. Information relating to the importance of enabling FDE (Why) was placed with the normal case (not enabled). Laying out the information in this way helped reduce the amount of text under each dropdown label on the main screen and prevented users from getting confused.</p> -->
                <p>Not all Android devices are shipped with disk encryption, so users have to manually enable encryption. This was the normal case that the Beta version addressed. But the feature identified encrypted devices with no passcode as non-encrypted devices. It was thus necessary to design a set of remediation instructions for this edge case. </p>
                <img src="FDE.png" alt="FDE final design">
                <!-- <p> We wanted the users to understand that the Call to Action (CTA) links for How and Why would lead to a new page in the app itself and not to a new page in the browser. It was also necessary to make the links appear as clickable to the users. To tackle these two issues, I changed the tone of the text in the links to first person to make them stand out from the text under each label. I also added a slight background fill for the links to make them pop out on the screen. This design concept tested well through multiple rounds of hallway testing. </p> -->
                <p>The edge case for OS issue resulted from the fact that manufacturers do not provide updates to older models of cellphones. Thus, it was necessary to educate the users the latest OS supported by a device was not the same as the latest OS available for Android OS. </p>
                <img src="duo_OSedgecase.png" alt="OS final design">
                <br>
                <p><b>III. Rethinking the user interaction</b></p>
                <!-- <p>There were two ways a user could access the Security Checkup feature in the Beta version – by clicking on the feature on the main screen or by going to Settings menu of Duo Mobile. We did not want the feature to persist on the main screen as it would take up space and also distract the user from approving push notifications. To tackle this issue, I worked closely with an engineering intern on the Mobile team to brainstorm different ways of showing the feature.</p> -->
                <p>The goal of the Security Checkup feature was to notify users of the security issues without being persistent (fixed) on the home screen. I came up with the simple idea of a pop-up and thought of testing it out. However, this idea of the feature popping-up on the main screen tested poorly in hallway testing. Through a 1:1 design session with my mentor, we came up with a toast-like functionality for the feature. This design concept tested well through initial testing and was subsequently approved by the Product Manager on the team. </p>
                <img src="SC_oldinteraction.png" alt="concept iterations">
                <!-- <p>We came up with the simple idea of a pop-up and thought of testing it out. However, this idea of the feature popping-up on the main screen tested poorly in hallway testing. The test subjects reported thinking that they would need to dismiss the pop-up before approving any notifications in the app. This exploration did not work well, so we got back to the whiteboard.</p> -->
                <p>An important aspect of the user interaction was that it should allow users to dismiss the notification. Also, I had to account for educating the users who wanted to dismiss the notification, by informing that they could access the feature through the Settings menu of the app. I designed various iterations for combining both the education and dismiss functionality, by playing around with the visual design and copy. I ended up using a design pattern for the dialog which was already present in the app, thus saving some development resources.</p>

                <img src="duo_flow.png" alt="Final flow for Security Checkup">
                <!-- <p>Through a feedback session with my mentor, we came up with a toast-like functionality for the feature. This design concept tested well through initial testing and was approved by the Product Manager on the team. The final step involved ironing out the kinks in the flow of this feature. Designing a user journey map to view the feature from a user’s perspective proved to be really valuable in conceptualizing the entire behavior of the feature. By putting ourselves in our user's shoes, we were able to find out the pain points in the flow that would have lead to a poor experience at the user’s end.</p> -->

                <br>
                <h4>SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT</h4>
                <p>With the designs tested and approved by the senior designers, I handed them off to the developers though a tool called Zepelin. I developed the Android UI screens only while the iOS ones were developed based off my designs. Text (landing text + remediation instructions) and assets (icons and illustrations) were some of the other deliverables that I delivered to the developers. The feature was released in late September and was made available to all Duo users. However, to enable access to this feature for all users in an environment, IT Admins need to configure this feature through the Admin Panel first. </p>
                
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>WHAT I DELIVERED</h4>
                <p>By the end of my internship, I had -
                <ul>
                    <li>Redesigned the flow, icons, text and delivered high quality assets for Security Checkup feature on Duo Mobile (Android)</li>
                    <li>Designed a small functionality in the Duo Admin Panel for turning on the feature </li>
                    <li>Moderated 4 usability testing sessions</li>
                    <li>Worked collaboratively with user researchers, developers and a PM</li>
                </ul></p>
                
                <br>
                <br>
                <h4>LOOKING BACK AT A WONDERFUL SUMMER</h4>
                <p>I was fortunate enough to spend my summer at a wonderful company being surrounded by some of the kindest people I have ever met. Working in a professional environment at Duo made me aware of my weaknesses as a designer and helped polish my communication skills while regular collaboration with developers taught me about proper methods for documentation and delivering  design assets.
