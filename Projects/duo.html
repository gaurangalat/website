                <!-- <p>Duo Mobile works with Duo Security's 2-factor authentication service and can generate passcodes for login, receive push notifications for easy, one-tap authentication. My primary project was to redesign the Security Checkup feature, which was a released as a Beta only feature (Admin only) in early 2017, to make it suitable for all Duo users (GA release). Since this project involved changing the target audience of the feature completely, I had to work on various aspects of the feature such as language, iconography and interactions.</p>

                <h4>WHAT DOES SECURITY CHECKUP DO?</h4>
                <p>Security Checkup informs the user about the security hygiene of their device by alerting them to issues such as no passcode, out of date OS, etc and providing instructions for remediation of the detected issue. The objective of the feature is to caution the user about the security issues while being unobstrusive i.e. not compromising on any functionality of the app.  -->

                    <!-- The Security Checkup feature, used to check the security hygiene of a device, had two aspects to it â€“ WHY and HOW. After alerting the user to issues such as no passcode, out of date OS, etc, it aimed to highlight practices (WHY) and provide instructions for remediation of the detected issue (HOW). The objective of the feature is to caution the user about the security issues while being unobstrusive i.e. not compromising on any functionality of the app. -->

                <h4>WHAT WAS THE ISSUE?</h4>
                <p>An important aspect of the feature is to provide instructions for remediation of the detected issues. Since Duo's users come from a variety of backgrounds, it was essential that the instructions were concise and easy to understand. The feature in the Beta version failed to provide the remediation instructions </p>
                <p>We wanted the Security Checkup feature to not 
                </p>
                
                <br>
                <p>Android OS having different versions, coupled with manufacturer specific OS versions proved to be a challenge while writing</p>
                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
                <h3>Expedia turned out to be the most popular choice among users for booking flights and hotels but not necessarily the app</h3>
