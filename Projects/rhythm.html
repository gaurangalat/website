    <h1>Rhythm- Networking App for Musicians</h1>

        <li><b>Task</b>: Develop a solution to any problem faced by a local community. The final form of the solution should be an application/ website</li>
        <li><b>What I did</b>: Interviews, survey, sketching, storyboarding, paper prototyping, wireframing,  hi-fi prototyping</li>
        <p style="font-size: 12px;line-height: 18px;"><i>*Individual project for Interaction design class, Sept-Dec 2016</i></p>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>The main stages of this project included defining the problem, sketching, storyboarding, paper Prototyping and creating a hi-fi prototype, interspersed with peer feedback sessions. The overall process was broken down into the following stages -
    <ol>
        <li>Identify the Community</li>
        <li>Identify the Problem</li>
        <li>Establish the Goal</li>         
        <li>Design Stages (Sketching to Prototyping)</li>
    </ol>
    </p> 
    <br>
    <h4>THE COMMUNITY CHOSEN</h4>
    <p>I decided to focus on the problems of the student musicians at the University of Michigan. The university has a lot of student organizations such as Maize Collective, Stamp Nation, The Jam Club, that cater to musicians on the campus. I decided to choose this community because I am a musician myself and an active part of one such organization called The Jam Club. I decided on event promoters as my secondary audience as they played a huge role in giving musicians a platform to perform and grow.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>SCOPING DOWN THE PROBLEM</h4>
    <p>
    To find out where the needs of my target audience were not being met, I conducted interviews with the heads of student organizations catering to student musicians, as well as student musicians themselves. I eventually conducted a total of 6 interviews. A Google form was also sent out to student musicians to ask them about their attitudes and behavior. I devised 3 <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwpAOQIxmniANkg2X1VmajdnREU?usp=sharing" target="_blank">personas</a> and 1 anti-persona based on the interview data and survey responses.</p>

      <h4>MARKET ANALYSIS</h4>
      <p>Various existing applications and tools for the music community already existed, but each catered to different needs of the musicians. A unified platform that resolves all the problems of upcoming musicians had not yet been developed. Studying these platforms helped me understand the areas of the market that weren't explored.</p>

        <h4>DESIGN EXPLORATIONS</h4>
          <p>With the data uncovered from the needs asssessment phase, I sketched out 8 unique ideas that would solve the problem. The sketches were very rough and this phase was meant to help diverge the thinking process.</p>

        <h4>STORYBOARDING THE EXPLORATIONS</h4>
          <p>The next stage involved storyboarding the 8 sketches to uncover additional insights and explore real world implementations.</p>
      </div>
    </div> 
  </div> 

  <div class="para">
    <h4>ESTABLISHING THE DESIGN OBJECTIVE</h4>
    <p>The sketches and storyboards helped shape the structure of my final idea. I established a project objective – designing a tool for local and upcoming musicians to connect and interact – to guide me while making design decisions further ahead in the process. My final vision of the project was for a platform that would -
    <ul>
        <li>Increase and promote social interaction between local musicians</li>
        <li>Contain information about the local musicians</li>
        <li>Foster collaboration among musicians</li>
    </ul> 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="para">
    <h4>DEVELOPING THE FEATURES</h4>
    <p>Feedback from the users, on my vision and the sketches, proved valuable in narrowing down the features in my deliverable. I finally decided on the following as my primary features
    <ul>
    <li>Personal Profile - The Profile would display information about a musician's preferred genres, instruments played, website/ Soundcloud links and a short bio. For Promoters, it would display the Club affiliation, genres preferred, club website and a bio.</li>
    <li>Events Section - Options to Create Events/ Invite friends to an event</li>
    <li>Spotlight Section - Every month, the community will upvote an artist based on the track they submit. Promoters can book the top ranking artists, after hearing the mix and visiting their profile.</li>
    <li>Search for artists - Artists can be searched on the app by name/ genres/ instruments played.</li>
    </ul></p>

        <h4> PAPER PROTOTYPING</h4>
          <p>To test out interactions, I developed a paper prototype for the musician and event promoter user flow. Peer feedback received on the prototype helped me decide the minute details in the hi-fi prototype. The video shows the musician user flow while the promoter user flow can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwpAOQIxmniAeUZ5b3dpQmZ4SGc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

        <h4>MOCKUPS</h4> 
          <p>I designed the mockups with Adobe XD over Sketch due to the former's ability to convert screens to interactive prototype with just a switch from Design to Prototype Mode. The limited capabilities of making a design interactive in XD were sufficient for my final project deliverable.</p>

Being an Android user, it was easy for me to design the app for the Android OS because I was familiar with navigation, interactions and behavior for Android. For a thorough explanation of the proposed app and the whole process, check out the final report <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwpAOQIxmniAS3ZQejRPMjRKN0U/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

    <h4>REFLECTING ON THE PROJECT</h4>
      <p>With this being my first ever project in the Interaction Design domain, I learnt a lot about the various methodologies of design. While I briefly did User Research through interviews and surveys, I realized the importance of involving users early and often to shape the course of the design process. The final prototype I delivered was based on Material Design Guidelines, but my designs did not follow all the rules. I would love to revisit this project in the near future, design a better UI and test it out with my users.</p>
