				<h1>Rhythm- Networking App for Musicians</h1>
                <h2>Conceptualized and designed a networking app for musicians* </h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Task</b>: Develop a solution to any problem faced by a local community. The final form of the solution should be an application/ website</li>

                </ul>
                </div>
                <h4>WORKFLOW</h4>
                <p>The various phases of the project included defining the problem, Sketching, Storyboarding, Paper Prototyping and creating a hi-fi Prototype, interspersed with peer feedback sessions. The overall process was broken down into the following stages -
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the Community</li>
                    <li>Identify the Problem</li>
                    <li>Establish the Goal</li>
                    <li>Use Participatory Design</li>
                    <li>Design Stages (Sketching to Prototyping)</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                
                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
                <h4>THE COMMUNITY CHOSEN</h4>
                <p>I decided to focus on the problems of the student musicians at the University of Michigan. The university has a lot of student organizations such as Maize Collective, Stamp Nation, The Jam Club, that cater to musicians on the campus. I decided to choose this community because I am a musician myself and an active part of one such organization called The Jam Club. To increase the interaction, I decided to include event promoters as my secondary audience. They could use this tool to discover local talent in their area.</p>
                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
                <h4>SCOPING DOWN THE PROBLEM</h4>
                <p>
                To find out where the needs of my target audience were not met, I conducted interviews with heads of student organizations catering to student musicians as well as student musicians themselves. Over the whole process, about 5-6 interviews were conducted. A Google form was also sent out to ask users about their attitudes and behavior. 
                </p>
                <h3>Through this research phase, I discovered that local musicians have no single medium to interact and be aware of the events happening in the community.
                </h3>
                
                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
                <h4>THE CONCEPT</h4>
                <p>With the data uncovered from the needs asssessment phase, I sketched out 8 unique ideas. The sketches were very rough and this phase was meant to help diverge the thinking process. The next stage involved <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwpAOQIxmniANzdESHhPSmpMbHM?usp=sharing" target="_blank">storyboarding</a> the 8 sketches to uncover additional insights into the ideas.</p>
                <img src="sketches_582.png" alt="sketches">
                <p>Sketches and storyboards helped me narrow down my final idea. I established the objective as follows â€“ designing a tool for local and upcoming musicians to connect and interact. The final vision of the project looked something like this -
                <ul>
                    <li>A platform that connects all musicians and promotes interaction.</li>
                    <li>A platform that holds information about various musicians.</li>
                    <li>A platform that fosters collaboration.</li>
                </ul> 
                </p>

                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
                
                <h4>DEVELOPING THE FEATURES</h4>
                <p>After sketching out the ideas and storyboarding them, I turned to my target audience and my peers for feedback. The feedback was helpful in narrowing down the scope of the tool to the following features -
                    <ul>
                    <li><b>Personal Profile for each Musician/ Promoter</b> - The Profile would display information about a musician's preferred genres, instruments played, website/ Soundcloud links and a short bio. For Promoters, it would display the Club affiliation, genres preferred, club website and a bio.</li>
                    <li><b>Events Section</b> - Options to Create Events/ Invite friends to an event</li>
                    <li><b>Spotlight Section</b> - Every month, the community will upvote an artist based on the track they submit. Promoters can book the top ranking artists, after hearing the mix and visiting their profile.</li>
                    <li><b>Search for artists</b> - Artists can be searched on the app by name/ genres/ instruments played.</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>
                <h4>PROTOTYPING</h4>
                <p>With the final design in mind, I developed a paper prototype for both the musician as well as event promoter user flow. The freedom and flexibility offered by the lo-fi prototyping method of using paper mockups was really useful to fine tune the interactions of the final app. The feedback received on this phase shaped the details in the hi-fi prototype.

                <p>The <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/8cda7619-a68a-481e-8f13-c4ba9378575d/">final prototype</a> was created using Adobe XD. I decided to go with Adobe XD over Sketch due to the former's ability to convert screens to interactive prototype with just a switch from Design to Prototype Mode. The limited capabilities of making a design interactive in XD were sufficient for my final project deliverable. Being an Android user, it was easy for me to design the app for the Android OS. There is still a scope for improvement, in terms of design and functionality, and I am sure I will get back to this project when I have time.</p>
