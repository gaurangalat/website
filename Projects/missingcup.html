                            <p><b>THE TASK</b></p>
                            <p>Create a 1-minute pitch for an information tool, service, collection or similar related to a social movement.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>THE ISSUE</b></p>
                            <p> Our research found out that 800,000 children go missing every year in the United States. 33% of missing children in the United States are black, which amounts to about 265,000 children per year. However, only 19.5% of media coverage in missing children cases is dedicated to cases of missing black children.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>THE IDEA</b></p>
                            <p>Cup sleeves having information about missing persons, printed in thermochromic ink. As the temperature changes, more information about the individual appears. This leads to efficient utilization of the space on the sleeves without compromising on the information.</p>
                            <p><b>THE PROCESS</b></p>
                            <p>The team decided to devote one hour to researching for a social issue. After an hour, we engaged in a brainstorming session and pooled in our ideas. After weighing the pros and cons, we decided to work on the issue of missing African-American children. The cases would be pulled from Black And Missing, a foundation dedicated to finding missing black persons. </p>
                            <p>We originally thought of building a modular sticker sheet, which would be distributed to agencies and companies who would love to volunteer for the cause. This sheet would hold information in various sticker sizes, with the smallest one having the essential information and the larger ones, building on top of the smallest one would hold more information. After running this through a faculty, we were advised that the idea, inspite of being good, lacked a certain 'sexy' factor. This is when one of the team members suggested that instead of static stickers, we could use stickers with thermochromic ink, essentially an ink that changes color depending on temperature. After getting the thumbs up from the faculty, we sat down to work, having to start almost all over again with the design.</p>
                            <p><b>AN IMPORTANT PIVOT</b></p>
                            <p>We discarded the idea of stickers and welcomed the idea of sleeves for beverages. The rationale behind this was that beverages, hot and cold, get far more exposure than any commodity, because people carry them around. To capitalize on this, a sleeve with information about missing children would get circulated around much more often than any other product. This idea was inspired by the idea of putting Missing Persons information on milk cartons. This idea didn't do well since the cartons wouuld go from the shop directly to the consumer's refrigertor. However, we were confident that our idea would do better than the Milk Carton idea because beverages both hot and cold, see more of the public than a milk carton. </p>
                            <p><b>THE DESIGN</b></p>
                            <p>The proposed idea is applicable to both hot and cold beverages. The Missing individual's face, last seen location and description would be the first thing to be displayed on the sleeve. As the hot beverage would cool down, or a cold beverage would approach the room temperature, information like the Black and Missing website and other links would appear. Further temperature changes would result in the next pieces of information, the individual's photo and the helpline. The final screen would be the hashtag MissingCup to be used on social media and other social media links dedicated to finding that individual.</p>
                            
                            <p>To efficiently utilize this medium, local coffee shops could be brought in for the distribution. The sleeves would have information about missing black individuals based in that region. Getting local coffee shops would help spread the awareness of missing locals in the very region that they were from. </p>
