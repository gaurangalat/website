                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Developed as the final project for Interaction Design class at UMSI</p>
                                <!-- <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/roundicons-free.png" alt=""> -->
                                <p><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b></p>
                                <p>Develop a solution to any problem faced by a local community. The final form of the solution should be an application/ website.</p>
                                <p><b>THE COMMUNITY</b></p>
                                <p>I decided to focus on the problems of the student musicians at the University of Michigan. The university has a lot of student organizations such as Maize Collective, Stamp Nation, The Jam Club, that cater to musicians on the campus. I decided to choose this community because I am a musician myself and an active part of The Jam Club. I also targeted the secondary audience of Music Promoters and Club Owners, are unaware of the local musicians in their area.</p>
                                <p><b>THE NEEDS</b></p>
                                <p>Local Musicians in an area have no single medium to interact as well be aware of the events happening in the community. 
                                By zeroing in on the community, I could easily find out the needs of my target audience.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A platform that connects all musicians and promotes interaction.</li>
                                    <li>A platform that holds information about various musicians.</li>
                                    <li>A platform that fosters collaboration.</li>
                                </ul> </p>
                                <p><b>THE IDEA</b></p>
                                <p>A tool for local and upcoming Musicians to connect and interact. Also a tool for Event Promoters to discover local talent in their area.</p>
                                <p><b>WORKFLOW</b></p>
                                <p>The various phases of the project included defining the problem, Sketching, Storyboarding, Paper Prototyping and creating a hi-fi Prototype, interspersed with peer feedback sessions.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Identify the Community</li>
                                    <li>Identify the Problem</li>
                                    <li>Establish the Goal</li>
                                    <li>Use Participatory Design</li>
                                    <li>Design Stages (Sketching to Prototyping)</li>
                                </ol>
                                To get more insights about the problem, I conducted interviews with heads of student organizations catering to student musicians as well as student musicians themselves. Over the whole process, about 5-6 interviews were conducted. A Google form was also sent out to ask users about their preferences of features in the app. Feedback sessions were held after almost every major stage in the design process, with peers and student musicians. 
                                </p>
                                <p><b>MAIN FEATURES</b></p>
                                <p><ul>
                                    <li>Personal Profile for each Musician/ Promoter<p>The Profile would display information about a musician's preferred genres, instruments played, website/ Soundcloud links and a short bio. For Promoters, it would display the Club affiliation, genres preferred, club website and a bio. </p></li>
                                    <li>Events Section<p>Options to Create Events/ Invite friends to an event</p></li>
                                    <li>Spotlight Section<p>Every month, the community will upvote an artist based on the track they submit. Promoters can book the top ranking artists, after hearing the mix and visiting their profile. </p></li>
                                    <li>Search for artists<p>Artists can be searched on the app by name/ genres/ instruments played. </p></li>
                                </ul></p>
                                <p><b>OUTCOME</b></p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="mnap.png" alt="Prototype" style="max-height:400px">
                                <p>The final prototype was created using Adobe XD. I decided to go with Adobe XD over Sketch due to the former's ability to convert screens to interactive prototype with just a switch from Design to Prototype Mode. Also the built-in feature to share the interactive prototype online was a huge advantage. I quickly picked up Adobe XD because of my previous experience with the Adobe CC suite. The prototype is based on Google's Material Design. I tried to ensure that the design follows all the guidelines but given the time constraints, I could not spend time perfecting it. You can view the interactive prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/8cda7619-a68a-481e-8f13-c4ba9378575d/">here</a>. There is still a scope for improvement, in terms of design and functionality, and I am sure I will get back to this project when I have time.</p>

                                <h2>EmoSense - Emotion Sensory Design</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Prototype developed at the Critical Making Workshop organized by MISC-DoIIT at UMSI</p>
                                <p>EmoSense is a wearable product that lets you share your emotions. The main idea behind developing EmoSense is to let users share  their experiences using wearables. Wearable technology today offers an experience only to the user using it. The aim of EmoSense is to create sharing of emotions using wearable technology.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="ideas.jpg" alt="Ideas" style="max-height:400px">
                                <p><b> THE ISSUE</b></p>
                                <p>Almost all people experience emotional problems at a stage in their life. Sometimes they prefer to deal with it on their own and do not wish to let others know of their suffering. Sometimes they long for someone to help them out, and talk to them. Some prefer to get medical assistance. Usually people try to ignore the problem and then it deteriorates into a serious condition, resulting into depression and possibly suicide.</p>
                                <p><b> IDEA PROPOSED</b></p>
                                <p>The objective was to develop a pair of wearables, where one would be worn by a user and the second would be worn by another. By employing haptic feedback, User A can be made self-reliant by turning on the vibration when stress is detected, or User B can be notified that User A is feeling stressed. User B can then activate the heating pad placed inside the glove of User A. The heating pad is supposed to provide warmth and comfort to the user A.</p>
                                <p><b> PROCESS</b></p>
                                <p>The team was formed because of our common objective, to share experiences using wearable technology. Holding on to this thought, we started brainstormed using post-its and grouped ideas sharing a theme. We then devised 3 different personas, envisioning people who would really use the product. We targeted negative emotions of fear, anxiety, anger, stress and sadness. After listing down the ideas that could target the emotions, we looked at the inventory of devices available. Refining the idea again considering the plausibility of each, we moved on to the sketching phase and sketched out design ideas. By this time we had a clear idea of what we wanted to implement. The next and final step was prototyping, which began with individual sensor testing and finally resulted into sensor integration with LilyPad Arduino.</p>
                                <p><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b></p>

                                <p>The prototype integrated about 80% of the final idea, and basically had a 2-way communication mechanism. Due to time constraints, work on wireless transmission had to be stopped midway and we focused only on the integration and 2-way communication. Setup mounted on left hand symbolises the circuit on an individual, while the setup on the right hand shows the circuit for another individual.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered img-rotated" src="EmoSense.jpg" alt="Final Prototype" style="max-height:400px">
                                <p>Circuitry mounted on the left hand (see pic), used a Muscle Sensor to measure EMG signals. When a stress in the muscles was detected, the haptic mototr on the right hand would start vibrating, thus serving as a notification. The right hand had a flex sensor and anytime the wrist is closed, it would send a signal to the left hand, turning on the heating pad. In the video attached, we replaced the heating pad with a simple LED on the LilyPad for demonstration purposes.</p>
                                <p>The developed product served the following purposes- 
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Self reliance</b> due to haptic feedback</li>
                                    <li><b>Peer support</b> system</li>
                                    <li><b>Sharing</b> of emotional experience</li>
                                    <li><b>Notifying</b> friends/ family/ doctors about issue</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p><b>CHALLENGES</b></p>
                                <p>The main challenges we faced were to integrate all the sensors and actuators, and enable wireless communication in under a day. Due to limited time and choice of devices available, ideas from the brainstorming session had to modified to include the practical aspects of the project.</p>
                                <p><b>FUTURE</b></p>
                                <p>The wiring between the two setups can be replaced by using WiFi or Bluetooth technology. to increase self reliance, signal can be sen to a Bluetooth speaker so that calimng sountracks can be played. This signal can also be used to modify ambient lighting in the room to induce a feeling of comfort and warmth.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://gamesurconf.com/us/">#gamesUR </a>Summit is an annual conference presented by Games User Research Special Interest Group <a href="http://gamesuserresearchsig.org/">(GURSIG)</a> of the International Game Developers Association <a href="http://igda.org">(IGDA)</a> alongside Game Developers Conference. The theme of this year's GUR Summit is Innovation. We submitted a proposal on what we would like to present as a poster at GUR and got accepted. We are currently working on the poster and getting some research done before the event on 28th February 2017.</p>
                                <p><b>TOPIC</b></p>
                                <p>Use of Haptic Feedback in Educational Games for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</p>
                                <p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
                                <p>Children, diagnosed with ASD, take a considerably longer time to learn basic skills and require intimate one-on-one guidance from trained professionals. Children with ASD also have affected attention and engagement as their senses are often hyper- or hypo-sensitive. Since children with ASD require additional attention in regards to these areas, sensory and visual techniques, such as vibration or weighted vests, are highly emphasized in educational settings. The use of vibration has been found to calm stress and anxiety for children with ASD. Haptic feedback can also be used to facilitate learning.</p>
                                <p><b>RESEARCH PLAN</b></p>
                                <p>We will focus our research on popular social story games and applications typically used in Early Childhood Education (ECSE) Classrooms, like Choiceworks, Lumikids, and Soundtouch.  Through exploring the traditional use of haptic feedback in ECSE classrooms, we hope to understand how it can be incorporated and implemented with the use of social story games and applications to help students learn and cope better. We hope our research can serve the autistic community with innovative game methods that can be easily implemented and accessible. Through the use of haptic feedback and the example of story board-focused games and applications, we hope to understand how wearable technology can be used in an educational setting, as well as for people with special learning and social needs.</p>
