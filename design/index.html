                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Project for class SI 582- Introduction to Interaction Design </p>
                                <!-- <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/roundicons-free.png" alt=""> -->
                                <p><b>THE TASK</b></p>
                                <p>Develop a solution to any problem faced by a local community. The final form of the solution should be an application/ website.</p>
                                <p><b>THE COMMUNITY</b></p>
                                <p>I decided to focus on the problems of the student musicians at the University of Michigan. The university has a lot of student organizations such as Maize Collective, Stamp Nation, The Jam Club, that cater to musicians on the campus. I decided to choose this community because I am a musician myself and an active part of The Jam Club. I also targeted the secondary audience of Music Promoters and Club Owners, are unaware of the local musicians in their area.</p>
                                <p><b>THE NEEDS</b></p>
                                <p>Local Musicians in an area have no single medium to interact as well be aware of the events happening in the community. 
                                By zeroing in on the community, I could easily find out the needs of my target audience.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A platform that connects all musicians and promotes interaction.</li>
                                    <li>A platform that holds information about various musicians.</li>
                                    <li>A platform that fosters collaboration.</li>
                                </ul> </p>
                                <p><b>THE IDEA</b></p>
                                <p>A tool for local and upcoming Musicians to connect and interact. Also a tool for Event Promoters to discover local talent in their area.</p>
                                <p><b>WORKFLOW</b></p>
                                <p>The various phases of the project included defining the problem, Sketching, Storyboarding, Paper Prototyping and creating a hi-fi Prototype, interspersed with peer feedback sessions.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Identify the Community</li>
                                    <li>Identify the Problem</li>
                                    <li>Establish the Goal</li>
                                    <li>Use Participatory Design</li>
                                    <li>Design Stages (Sketching to Prototyping)</li>
                                </ol>
                                To get more insights about the problem, I conducted interviews with heads of student organizations catering to student musicians as well as student musicians themselves. Over the whole process, about 5-6 interviews were conducted. A Google form was also sent out to ask users about their preferences of features in the app. Feedback sessions were held after almost every major stage in the design process, with peers and student musicians. 
                                </p>
                                <p><b>MAIN FEATURES</b></p>
                                <p><ul>
                                    <li>Personal Profile for each Musician/ Promoter<p>The Profile would display information about a musician's preferred genres, instruments played, website/ Soundcloud links and a short bio. For Promoters, it would display the Club affiliation, genres preferred, club website and a bio. </p></li>
                                    <li>Events Section<p>Options to Create Events/ Invite friends to an event</p></li>
                                    <li>Spotlight Section<p>Every month, the community will upvote an artist based on the track they submit. Promoters can book the top ranking artists, after hearing the mix and visiting their profile. </p></li>
                                    <li>Search for artists<p>Artists can be searched on the app by name/ genres/ instruments played. </p></li>
                                </ul></p>
                                <p><b>OUTCOME</b></p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="mnap.png" alt="Prototype" style="max-height:400px">
                                <p>The final prototype was created using Adobe XD. I decided to go with Adobe XD over Sketch due to the former's ability to convert screens to interactive prototype with just a switch from Design to Prototype Mode. Also the built-in feature to share the interactive prototype online was a huge advantage. I quickly picked up Adobe XD because of my previous experience with the Adobe CC suite. The prototype is based on Google's Material Design. I tried to ensure that the design follows all the guidelines but given the time constraints, I could not spend time perfecting it. You can view the interactive prototype <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/8cda7619-a68a-481e-8f13-c4ba9378575d/">here</a>. There is still a scope for improvement, in terms of design and functionality, and I am sure I will get back to this project when I have time.</p>

                                <h2>Enhancing Patient Experience in the ED</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Project for class SI 501 - Contextual Inquiry (client: University of Michigan Health System)</p>
                                <p><b>THE TASK</b></p>
                                <p>Recommend solution(s) to the client's problem(s) using the process of Contextual Inquiry</p>
                                <p><b>CLIENT BRIEF</b></p>
                                <p>It has been found from patient relations data, as well as patient satisfaction data, that the wait in the Emergency Department (ED) is excessive, and the lack of communication makes it even more difficult. The hospital wanted a team to investigate the best way to communicate the wait, and to assess how they might otherwise improve the patient experience in the adult ED at UMHS. The hospital has a system that informs about the approximate wait time, but they were hesitant to make it available to the patients since they found it to be too technical for the patients. </p>
                                <p><b>THE RECOMMENDATION</b></p>
                                <p>After working closely with the clients for 3 months, we presented the following recommendations to solve the client's problem.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Introduce a Patient Update form</li>
                                    <li>Make changes to the infrastructure</li>
                                    <li>Keep a check on the staff behavior</li>
                                </ul></p>
                                <p><b>THE PROCESS</b></p>
                                <p><img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="OverviewDiagram_501.jpg" alt="Workflow" style="max-height:500px">
                                We first met with the client to get a better understanding of the problem. This was crucial since we were able to ask more questions and get much better insights into the probem in addition to the client's brief. To get more information about the problem, we did a background research report with each of us picking a different topic like client history, competetive ananlysis, etc. I did a literature review of the concept of wait time and the factors affecting it.
                                </p>
                                <p>We established the Interview Protocols and narrowed down potential interviewees. After working with our client, we scheduled the interviews. The interviewees were selected in a manner to gain perspective from diverse job roles. Each interview followed a semi-structured format, and lasted for about an hour. A certain number of questions to be asked were decided prior to the interview, and the rest were based on the interviewee's responses. After every interview, the team met for an interpretation session where the notes from the interview would be discussed and the information would be interpreted into brief statements. The team also conducted a couple of observation rounds nad noted down the findings.</p>
                                <p>The interpreted notes were used to create an Affinity diagram using post-its. Ideas with a common theme were grouped together. This helped us narrow down the notes to 5 themes. These themes were the findings, on the basis of which the recommendations were decided</p>  
                                <p><b>THE FINDINGS</b></p>
                                <p><ol>
                                    <li>ED inspires a negative mindset</li>
                                    <li>Infrastructure affects patient experience</li>
                                    <li>Wait time is unpredictable</li>
                                    <li>Patient are unaware of the process</li>
                                    <li>Communication needs to be improved</li>
                                </ol>
                                The scope of our project was limited to points 4 and 5, while point 3 was beyond our control. Considering these two points, we decided that Patient Education and Patient Communication was the solution to the problem. Our secondary solution was based on point 2.</p>
                                <p><b>THE LIMITATIONS</b></p>
                                <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Scope limited to the waiting room</li>
                                    <li>IUnpredictable nature of the wait time</li>
                                    <li>Lack of inpatient beds</li>
                                    <li>Small waiting room area</li>
                                </ul> 
                                </p>
                                <p><b>THE SOLUTION</b></p>
                                <p>I. Patient Education and Patient Communication</p>
                                <p><img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="501_form-01.png" alt="Workflow" style="max-height:500px">
                                We decided that a Patient Update form can be provided with the Wait Time System (WTS). The form has sections for both the staff and patient to fill out. The staff would check the boxes after every stage/ or an update, as the patient is going through the process. The patient, on the other hand, will cehck the symptoms at the start, as well as after any change in the condition. This was, the patients are aware of the whole process, as well as the staff is aware of the change in the patient's condition and can monitor their progress. There will be a few FAQs at the bottom of the form to educate the patients.</p>
                                <p>The WTS in the waiting room would show the approximate wait times for every triage level. In this way, the patients will be aware of the time they might need to wait. The WTS will also show infograohics about the whole ED process, from Check-in to getting seen by the physician. This will result into patients being aware of the process and will prevent them from setting improper expectations.</p>
                                <p>II. Infrastructure Modification</p>
                                <figure>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="UMHS.png" alt="Layout change">

                                </figure>
                                <p>From the interviews as well as the observation rounds, we found that infrastructure did affect the patient experience in the ED. A straight up solution would have been to increase the capacity of the ED but it was not feasible. So we decided to improve the current infrastructure. Following recommendations for the waiting room were provided to the client
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Change in the layout </li>
                                    <li>Including more charging ports and cables</li>
                                    <li>Changing the interiors (color scheme) </li>
                                    <li>Introducing murals and plants</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>EmoSense - Emotion Sensory Design</h2>
                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Prototype developed at the Critical Making Workshop organized by MISC-DoIIT at UMSI</p>
                                <p>EmoSense is a wearable product that lets you share your emotions. The main idea behind developing EmoSense is to let users share  their experiences using wearables. Wearable technology today offers an experience only to the user using it. The aim of EmoSense is to create sharing of emotions using wearable technology.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="ideas.jpg" alt="Ideas" style="max-height:400px">
                                <p><b> THE ISSUE</b></p>
                                <p>Almost all people experience emotional problems at a stage in their life. Sometimes they prefer to deal with it on their own and do not wish to let others know of their suffering. Sometimes they long for someone to help them out, and talk to them. Some prefer to get medical assistance. Usually people try to ignore the problem and then it deteriorates into a serious condition, resulting into depression and possibly suicide.</p>
                                <p><b> IDEA PROPOSED</b></p>
                                <p>The objective was to develop a pair of wearables, where one would be worn by a user and the second would be worn by another. By employing haptic feedback, User A can be made self-reliant by turning on the vibration when stress is detected, or User B can be notified that User A is feeling stressed. User B can then activate the heating pad placed inside the glove of User A. The heating pad is supposed to provide warmth and comfort to the user A.</p>
                                <p><b> PROCESS</b></p>
                                <p>The team was formed because of our common objective, to share experiences using wearable technology. Holding on to this thought, we started brainstormed using post-its and grouped ideas sharing a theme. We then devised 3 different personas, envisioning people who would really use the product. We targeted negative emotions of fear, anxiety, anger, stress and sadness. After listing down the ideas that could target the emotions, we looked at the inventory of devices available. Refining the idea again considering the plausibility of each, we moved on to the sketching phase and sketched out design ideas. By this time we had a clear idea of what we wanted to implement. The next and final step was prototyping, which began with individual sensor testing and finally resulted into sensor integration with LilyPad Arduino.</p>
                                <p><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b></p>

                                <p>The prototype integrated about 80% of the final idea, and basically had a 2-way communication mechanism. Due to time constraints, work on wireless transmission had to be stopped midway and we focused only on the integration and 2-way communication. Setup mounted on left hand symbolises the circuit on an individual, while the setup on the right hand shows the circuit for another individual.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered img-rotated" src="EmoSense.jpg" alt="Final Prototype" style="max-height:400px">
                                <p>Circuitry mounted on the left hand (see pic), used a Muscle Sensor to measure EMG signals. When a stress in the muscles was detected, the haptic mototr on the right hand would start vibrating, thus serving as a notification. The right hand had a flex sensor and anytime the wrist is closed, it would send a signal to the left hand, turning on the heating pad. In the video attached, we replaced the heating pad with a simple LED on the LilyPad for demonstration purposes.</p>
                                <p>The developed product served the following purposes- 
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Self reliance</b> due to haptic feedback</li>
                                    <li><b>Peer support</b> system</li>
                                    <li><b>Sharing</b> of emotional experience</li>
                                    <li><b>Notifying</b> friends/ family/ doctors about issue</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p><b>CHALLENGES</b></p>
                                <p>The main challenges we faced were to integrate all the sensors and actuators, and enable wireless communication in under a day. Due to limited time and choice of devices available, ideas from the brainstorming session had to modified to include the practical aspects of the project.</p>
                                <p><b>FUTURE</b></p>
                                <p>The wiring between the two setups can be replaced by using WiFi or Bluetooth technology. to increase self reliance, signal can be sen to a Bluetooth speaker so that calimng sountracks can be played. This signal can also be used to modify ambient lighting in the room to induce a feeling of comfort and warmth.</p>

                                <p><b>THE TASK</b></p>
                                <p>Create a 1-minute pitch for an information tool, service, collection or similar related to a social movement.</p>
                                
                                <p><b>THE ISSUE</b></p>
                                <p> Our research found out that 800,000 children go missing every year in the United States. 33% of missing children in the United States are black, which amounts to about 265,000 children per year. However, only 19.5% of media coverage in missing children cases is dedicated to cases of missing black children.
                                </p>
                                <p><b>THE IDEA</b></p>
                                <p>Cup sleeves having information about missing persons, printed in thermochromic ink. As the temperature changes, more information about the individual appears. This leads to efficient utilization of the space on the sleeves without compromising on the information.</p>
                                <p><b>THE PROCESS</b></p>
                                <p>The team decided to devote one hour to researching for a social issue. After an hour, we engaged in a brainstorming session and pooled in our ideas. After weighing the pros and cons, we decided to work on the issue of missing African-American children. The cases would be pulled from Black And Missing, a foundation dedicated to finding missing black persons. </p>
                                <p>We originally thought of building a modular sticker sheet, which would be distributed to agencies nd companies who would love to volunteer for the cause. This sheet would hold information in various sticker sizes, with the smallest one having the essential information and the larger ones, building on top of the smallest one would hold more information. After running this through a faculty, we were advised that the idea, inspite of being good, lacked a certain 'sexy' factor. This is when one of the team members suggested that instead of static stickers, we could use stickers with thermochromic ink, essentially an ink that changes color depending on temperature. After getting the thumbs up from the faculty, we sat down to work, having to start almost all over again with the design.</p>
                                <p><b>AN IMPORTANT PIVOT</b></p>
                                <p>We discarded the idea of stickers and welcomed the idea of sleeves for beverages. The rationale behind this was that beverages, hot and cold, get far more exposure than any commodity, because people carry them around. To capitalize on this, a sleeve with information about missing children would get circulated around much more often than any other product. This idea was inspired by the idea of putting Missing Persons information on milk cartons. This idea didn't do well since the cartons wouuld go from the shop directly to the consumer's refrigertor. However, we were confident that our idea would do better than the Milk Carton idea because beverages both hot and cold, see more of the public than a milk carton. </p>
                                <p><b>THE DESIGN</b></p>
                                <p>The proposed idea is applicable to both hot and cold beverages. The Missing individual's face, last seen location and description would be the first thing to be displayed on the sleeve. As the hot beverage would cool down, or a cold beverage would approach the room temperature, information like the Black and Missing website and other links would appear. Further temperature changes would result in the next pieces of information, the individual's photo and the helpline. The final screen would be the hashtag MissingCup to be used on social media and other social media links dedicated to finding that individual.</p>
                                
                                <p>To efficiently utilize this medium, local coffee shops could be brought in for the distribution. The sleeves would have information about missing black individuals based in that region. Getting local coffee shops would help spread the awareness of missing locals in the very region that they were from. </p>

                                <!-- <p class="item-intro text-muted">Poster entry that got accepted to GUR'17 </p> -->
                                
                                <p>The <a href="http://gamesurconf.com/us/">#gamesUR </a>Summit is an annual conference presented by Games User Research Special Interest Group <a href="http://gamesuserresearchsig.org/">(GURSIG)</a> of the International Game Developers Association <a href="http://igda.org">(IGDA)</a> alongside Game Developers Conference. The theme of this year's GUR Summit is Innovation. We submitted a proposal on what we would like to present as a poster at GUR and got accepted. We are currently working on the poster and getting some research done before the event on 28th February 2017.</p>
                                <p><b>TOPIC</b></p>
                                <p>Use of Haptic Feedback in Educational Games for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</p>
                                <p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
                                <p>Children, diagnosed with ASD, take a considerably longer time to learn basic skills and require intimate one-on-one guidance from trained professionals. Children with ASD also have affected attention and engagement as their senses are often hyper- or hypo-sensitive. Since children with ASD require additional attention in regards to these areas, sensory and visual techniques, such as vibration or weighted vests, are highly emphasized in educational settings. The use of vibration has been found to calm stress and anxiety for children with ASD. Haptic feedback can also be used to facilitate learning.</p>
                                <p><b>RESEARCH PLAN</b></p>
                                <p>We will focus our research on popular social story games and applications typically used in Early Childhood Education (ECSE) Classrooms, like Choiceworks, Lumikids, and Soundtouch.  Through exploring the traditional use of haptic feedback in ECSE classrooms, we hope to understand how it can be incorporated and implemented with the use of social story games and applications to help students learn and cope better. We hope our research can serve the autistic community with innovative game methods that can be easily implemented and accessible. Through the use of haptic feedback and the example of story board-focused games and applications, we hope to understand how wearable technology can be used in an educational setting, as well as for people with special learning and social needs.</p>
